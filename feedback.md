Dear [User],

I'm sorry to hear that your application for your daughter's autism assessment was rejected due to a lack of evidence for ASD. It can be challenging and frustrating when seeking support for your child. I'd be happy to help you critique the application and suggest improvements to strengthen it. The goal is to provide clear, detailed information that aligns with the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), helping professionals understand your daughter's needs more fully.

**Overall Feedback:**

Your application contains valuable information about your daughter's developmental delays and behaviors. However, to make a stronger case for an ASD assessment, it's important to present the information in a way that directly addresses the core characteristics of autism. These include:

1. **Deficits in social communication and social interaction** across multiple contexts.
2. **Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.**
3. **Symptoms present in early developmental period** (which you've provided, given her age).
4. **Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

By organizing your application around these criteria and providing specific examples, you can help professionals see how her behaviors align with ASD.

**Section-by-Section Critique and Suggestions:**

1. **Social Interaction and Communication**

   - **Current Description:**
     - General statements about her not understanding most of what is said.
     - Examples of limited vocabulary and not putting two words together.
     - Mention of not understanding pointing or directions she hasn't practiced.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Be more specific about her social communication difficulties.
     - **Example:** "At 20 months, she can say 'cup,' 'bye,' 'no,' and 'yeah,' but doesn't combine words into phrases like other children her age. She doesn't use gestures such as pointing or waving. When we point to an object, she doesn't follow the gesture to look at it."
     - Emphasize lack of joint attention (an important early sign of ASD): "She doesn't bring toys to show us or engage in shared attention during play."

2. **Misinterpretation or Misunderstanding**

   - **Current Description:**
     - She often ignores or gives minimal response because she doesn't understand.
     - Doesn't understand pointing or simple questions.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Provide specific scenarios.
     - **Example:** "When asked 'Where is your shoe?' she doesn't look for or retrieve it. If we point to a picture in a book and ask 'What's that?', she doesn't look or respond."
     - Mention any lack of response to her name: "She rarely responds when we call her name, even in a quiet environment."

3. **Communication Methods**

   - **Current Description:**
     - She doesn't share interests.
     - Gets attention by hitting, scratching, or crying.
     - Doesn't use gestures; shouts words without directing them at people.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Highlight the absence of typical communicative behaviors.
     - **Example:** "She doesn't point to request or show interest. Instead of using gestures or words to ask for something, she will cry or physically pull us towards what she wants. She doesn't nod or shake her head to indicate 'yes' or 'no.'"

4. **Expressing Feelings**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Hides her face when frustrated or angry.
     - Doesn't seek comfort when nervous.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Emphasize the lack of social-emotional reciprocity.

5. **Engagement with Others**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Nervous around unfamiliar people.
     - Doesn't greet family members or show happiness to see them.

   - **Current Description:**
     - Doesn't show interest in people's thoughts.
     - Ignores compliments or questions about her activities.

   - **Suggestions:**

**Interests and Behaviors**

1. **Play and Leisure Time**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Enjoys wandering, pacing, and carrying objects.
     - Repeats actions like opening and closing drawers.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Emphasize lack of imaginative play.
     - **Example:** "She doesn't engage in pretend play, such as feeding a doll or mimicking household activities. Instead, she lines up toys or repeatedly opens and closes drawers."

2. **Unusual or Intense Interests**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Obsession with climbing on and off chairs.
     - Repeatedly hands objects back to people.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Detail the intensity and how it disrupts daily activities.
     - **Example:** "She becomes fixated on climbing furniture and gets very upset if prevented. This behavior can last for extended periods and is difficult to redirect. Similarly, she insists on handing objects to us repeatedly, and any attempt to stop this leads to distress."

3. **Coping with Change**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Distressed in new environments.
     - Resists changes in routine.

   - **Suggestions:**

4. **Sensory Interests or Aversions**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Sensitivity to noise and light changes.
     - Unusual visual behaviors like squinting and looking out of the corners of her eyes.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Explain how these affect her daily life.

5. **Unusual Body Movements**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Eye movements, head tilting, stiffening body, toe-walking.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Mention any stereotyped or repetitive motor movements.
     - **Example:** "She frequently flaps her hands when excited or upset. She often tiptoe walks and rocks back and forth while sitting. These movements seem to soothe her and are observed multiple times a day."

**Impact on Daily Life**

- **Current Description:**
  - Distress affects social activities.
  - Difficulty communicating needs.
  - Wanders away from activities.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Emphasize the severity and how it limits her functioning.
  - **Example:** "Her inability to communicate verbally or understand instructions makes everyday tasks challenging. For example, she cannot tell us when she's hungry or in pain, leading to frequent frustration and meltdowns. Her wandering poses safety risks, requiring constant supervision."

**Learning**

1. **General Learning and Delays**

   - **Current Description:**
     - Delayed in multiple areas.
     - Difficulties due to lack of interest in toys/books.

   - **Suggestions:**
     - Provide developmental milestones and how she compares to peers.
     - **Example:** "At 20 months, she isn't meeting several developmental milestones. She isn't using at least 50 words, doesn't recognize familiar pictures in books, and isn't engaging in simple pretend play, all of which are expected at her age."

2. **Independence Skills**

   - **Current Description:**
     - No independence skills; still behaves like a baby.
     - Needs help after falling; climbs unsafely.

   - **Suggestions:**

**Parents/Carers Understanding**

- **Current Description:**
  - Parents understand autism; older children diagnosed.

- **Suggestions:**

---

**Child's Strengths**

- **Current Description:**
  - Likes animals; enjoys watching birds and cats.
  - Not scared to keep trying after falling.

- **Suggestions:**
  - Add more positive attributes to give a well-rounded picture.
  - **Example:** "She has a keen curiosity about nature and enjoys observing animals. She demonstrates determination in physical activities, showing resilience when she falls by getting back up and trying again."

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Use Clear, Specific Language:**
  - Replace vague statements with precise descriptions.
  - Avoid generalizations and focus on observable behaviors.

- **Align Behaviors with ASD Criteria:**
  - Familiarize yourself with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD and ensure the examples provided correspond to them.

- **Include Professional Opinions:**

**Final Thoughts:**

By refining your application to focus on specific behaviors related to ASD criteria, you provide clearer evidence of your daughter's needs. Remember to:

- **Be Objective:** Present facts without emotional language to allow professionals to assess the information impartially.
- **Stay Persistent:** If the application is rejected again, consider requesting a meeting to discuss the decision and ask for guidance on additional information they may require.
- **Seek Professional Assessments:** If you haven't already, schedule an appointment with a developmental pediatrician or a child psychologist experienced in ASD evaluations.

Your advocacy is crucial, and your efforts can make a significant difference in accessing the support your daughter needs. If you need further assistance or have questions about specific parts of the application, please don't hesitate to ask.

I hope these suggestions help you strengthen your application. Wishing you and your daughter all the best.
