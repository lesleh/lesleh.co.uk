I'm sorry to hear that your daughter's application for an autism assessment was rejected. Based on the information you provided, I've revised and expanded your responses to the application form questions to provide more detailed examples and clarity. These enhanced answers aim to present a comprehensive picture of your daughter's behaviors and challenges, which may assist in the reassessment process.

---

### **1. Describe and give examples of any concerns about the child/young person’s talking or understanding. How is it compared to other children their age?**

Our primary concern is that our daughter shows significant delays in both expressive and receptive language compared to other children her age. At 20 months, most children have a vocabulary of around 50 words and start combining words into simple phrases. However, our daughter can only say a few basic words such as "cup," "bye," "no," and "yeah." She does not combine words or form any phrases.

She does not understand most of what is said to her. She can only follow a few simple commands that she has practiced repeatedly, such as "sit down" or "put it back." She does not comprehend new directions or requests, like "bring me your shoes" or "find the dog in the book." When we try to teach her new words or point out objects, she often ignores what is being said.

Her speech is primarily babbling, and when she does say words, they are usually not directed at anyone. For instance, if she's thirsty, she will shout "cup" repeatedly until someone notices, but she doesn't address the request to anyone directly or make eye contact. When leaving a building, she will say "bye" even if no one is present, and she may continue saying it repeatedly. These behaviors contrast sharply with other children her age, who typically engage in more interactive communication and show interest in learning new words.

### **2. Describe and give examples of the child/young person misinterpreting or misunderstanding what someone means. Literal understanding, sarcasm, humour.**

Our daughter often misinterprets or does not understand what is being communicated to her. When we ask her to perform simple tasks like "please bring me your shoe" or "show me the dog in the book," she does not comprehend and does not respond appropriately. She does not understand gestures such as pointing; when we point at an object to draw her attention, she does not look in that direction or acknowledge that we're showing her something.

She struggles with yes-or-no questions. When asked a question that requires a yes or no answer, she may respond unpredictably, sometimes shaking her head or nodding inconsistently, suggesting she doesn't understand the question or the meaning of these gestures. Unlike other children her age, she does not pick up on non-verbal cues or understand the intent behind our communication, which affects her ability to engage with us and learn new concepts.

---

### **3. Describe and give examples of how the child/young person communicates with you. How do they get your attention, share what they like, ask for help?**

Our daughter primarily communicates her needs through crying or making loud vocalizations. She does not use gestures such as pointing, waving, or nodding to convey her needs or interests. To get our attention, she may physically reach out by hitting or scratching at our faces rather than calling out or using words.

For example, if she wants an object that is out of reach or needs help getting down from a chair, she will cry and wait for someone to assist her, rather than pointing to the object or attempting to get our attention verbally. When she uses words, she tends to shout them aloud but not in a directed manner; she does not make eye contact or address the words to a specific person.

She does not share her interests with us. She doesn't bring toys to show us or point out things she finds interesting. This lack of joint attention is concerning, as other children her age typically enjoy sharing experiences with others and engaging in interactive play.

---

### **4. How do they let you know how they are feeling? Consider different emotions, not just obvious ones like sadness/happiness.**

Our daughter expresses her emotions in ways that are often atypical for her age. When she is frustrated or angry, she avoids interaction by turning away and hiding her face under her hands, arms, or a blanket. She may grunt, cry, or exhibit aggressive behaviors such as hitting, scratching, or throwing objects.

When feeling nervous or anxious, she stands still, looks downward, and protrudes her lower lip, but she does not seek comfort or reassurance from us. Instead, she withdraws further. When interested in something, she may wander around the area observing quietly while making repetitive "hmm" sounds, but she doesn't point out or share her interest with us.

When she's excited, she displays physical behaviors like climbing onto the couch or bed and jumping up and down. However, she doesn't express excitement by engaging with others or sharing her joy. Overall, she does not use typical social cues to express her emotions and rarely seeks comfort or shares positive emotions with us.

---

### **5. Describe and give examples of how the child/young person engages with others. Children, adults, strangers, family members.**

Our daughter is often nervous around unfamiliar children and adults. If someone she doesn't know attempts to interact with her, she may shut down by ignoring them, hiding her face, or physically distancing herself by running away. She does not initiate interaction with strangers or unfamiliar people.

With family members like her grandparents, she tolerates their presence but does not show typical signs of recognition or excitement. She has never spontaneously greeted them or appeared happy to see them. 

She occasionally interacts with us and her two older sisters (aged 5 and 6), but usually only if we initiate the interaction. Even then, her interest is often brief and dependent on her mood. If she's not in the mood, she may become upset when someone tries to engage with her, turning her face away, crying, or displaying signs of anger. Sometimes, even direct eye contact or being spoken to can upset her, leading to withdrawal or negative reactions. Her limited engagement with others impacts her social development and ability to form relationships.

---

### **6. Describe and give examples of how the child/young person responds to others’ thoughts and feelings.**

Our daughter does not seem to recognize or respond to others' thoughts and feelings. For example, if we praise her by saying "Good job!" or try to engage her by asking about a toy she's holding, she typically ignores us and does not respond. She doesn't appear to notice when others are hurt or upset. If someone nearby is crying or showing distress, she does not react or show concern.

At times, even positive social interactions like smiling at her, saying "Good morning," or making eye contact can upset her if she is not in the mood. She may respond by crying, grunting, turning away, or looking upward to avoid eye contact. She may also walk away to disengage from the interaction.

She often does not respond when we call her name to gain her attention. There is a delay in her responses; for instance, if someone says "bye" to her, she may not respond at the time but might start saying "bye" minutes later, repeating it multiple times even when the person has left. Her lack of recognition and response to others' emotions and social cues affects her ability to connect with people around her.

### **7. What social relationships does the child/young person have? Friendships, siblings, peer groups, community groups.**

Our daughter is primarily with us, her parents, full-time. She attends stay-and-play sessions at children's centers but does not engage with the other children or adults there, even if she has seen them before. 

She has two older sisters, aged 5 and 6. While she is generally comfortable in their presence, she often prefers to be left alone. Sometimes she runs away from them when they try to interact with her and usually does not want to be bothered.

She also has extended family members, including grandparents, an aunt, and a cousin who is 6 years old. However, she shows little interest in interacting with them. She does not initiate contact or engage in social activities with them. Overall, she does not have friendships or participate in peer groups, and her social relationships are limited due to her lack of engagement and interest in others.

---

### **8. Describe and give examples of how the child/young person plays/spends their leisure time. Consider what they play with, who, and how.**

Our daughter spends much of her time engaging in repetitive behaviors and solitary activities. She enjoys wandering around the house, pacing back and forth. She often picks up soft toys and random objects, carrying them around with her. 

She is fascinated with opening and closing drawers repeatedly, spending long periods performing this activity. She likes dragging chairs around the room and pushing toy strollers. Climbing is another activity she enjoys; she frequently climbs onto chairs, couches, and beds, getting on and off repeatedly.

She has a tendency to pick up random objects and hand them to people over and over again. For example, if someone puts down an item like a phone or a cup, she will quickly pick it up and hand it back to them repeatedly, even after they set it aside. 

When she hears music, she enjoys jumping and rocking back and forth. However, she does not engage in pretend play or interactive games with others. She plays alone and does not involve others in her activities, which is atypical compared to her peers who are beginning to engage in cooperative play.

---

### **9. Describe and give examples of any unusual or intense interests the child/young person has. Describe the intensity and frequency.**

Our daughter has several intense and repetitive interests. She is highly focused on climbing onto and off of chairs, step stools, beds, and sofas. She will go around the room trying every chair, repeatedly getting on and off. She engages in this activity frequently throughout the day. When we attempt to stop or redirect her, she becomes very upset and cannot be easily soothed. Sometimes we have to remove the chairs to prevent her from continuing.

Another intense behavior is her compulsion to pick up objects and hand them to people repeatedly. For instance, if someone puts down their phone or cup, she will immediately pick it up and hand it back to them. If they set it down again, she repeats the action over and over. This behavior occurs very often and is difficult to interrupt; she becomes distressed if we try to redirect her attention, and we often have to remove the objects entirely to stop the behavior.

These activities occupy a significant portion of her time and seem beyond typical play. The intensity and frequency of these behaviors are concerning and affect her ability to engage in other activities.

### **10. Describe and give examples of how the child/young person copes if things change in their routine or environment.**

Our daughter has difficulty coping with changes in her routine or environment. When taken to new places, she becomes very distressed. For example, in unfamiliar environments, she may shut down by standing still, looking downward, and crying or protruding her lower lip. She does not explore new settings and may become immobile.

If there is a change in her daily routine, such as going to a shop at an unusual time, she resists by fighting getting dressed or ready to go out. During the trip, she may be upset, grunting or crying if we try to talk to her. She avoids eye contact by looking upward or turning her head away.

Her distress in response to changes makes it challenging to introduce new experiences or adjust her schedule, impacting our ability to engage in normal activities as a family.

---

### **11. Please describe and give examples of any sensory interests or aversions the child/young person might have.**

Our daughter exhibits several sensory behaviors and sensitivities. She often squints when looking at objects and avoids direct eye contact. Instead, she may look at people by getting very close to their faces or by looking past them. She may turn her head to the side and look out of the corner of her eye or completely turn away when someone tries to engage her visually.

She engages in repetitive movements such as rocking back and forth, shaking her head rapidly, spinning, and climbing. She frequently pulls on her clothes and rubs her hands on them, suggesting sensory-seeking behaviors.

She makes repetitive noises to herself, which seem to be self-stimulating. She is sensitive to loud noises; if the environment is too noisy, she covers her ears and cries. She also reacts negatively to changes in lighting; for example, if a light in the room is dimmed or turned off, she may become upset and cry.

These sensory interests and aversions affect her daily functioning and can lead to distress in various environments.

---

### **12. Please give any examples of unusual body movements the child/young person does.**

Our daughter displays several unusual body movements. She frequently makes unusual eye movements such as squinting, rolling her eyes, looking at things from the corner of her eyes, pointing her eyes upward, and blinking or squeezing her eyes tightly.

She often tilts her head to the side and shakes her head rapidly. She makes facial expressions such as scrunching her nose or moving her mouth into a frown, sometimes without an apparent reason.

When walking, she may hold her arms fixed behind her in the air. She sometimes tenses up and stiffens her body, including her legs. She often walks on her toes rather than flat-footed, which affects her balance. Her gait is unsteady for her age, and she falls frequently. These movements are atypical and may indicate sensory processing issues or other neurological concerns.

---

### **13. How do all the difficulties you described impact the child/young person or family’s day-to-day life?**

Our daughter's difficulties significantly impact her and our family's day-to-day life. She becomes distressed frequently, making social activities like playgroups challenging and stressful for her. Her inability to communicate her needs effectively leads to frustration for both her and us, as we often have to guess what she wants or needs.

Her limited understanding makes it difficult for her to learn new things or participate in age-appropriate activities. She does not tolerate interactions for long periods, often wandering away to engage in solitary, repetitive behaviors. This makes it hard to involve her in family activities or encourage socialization with peers.

Her distress in new environments and resistance to changes in routine limit our ability to engage in typical outings or activities. Additionally, her sensory sensitivities and unusual behaviors require constant supervision to ensure her safety, adding to the stress on our family. We are concerned about her future development and her ability to integrate into social and educational settings without appropriate support.

### **Learning**

#### **Please provide information about the child/young person’s general learning. Is there an identified delay? Is it in line with their peers? Any areas of overachievement?**

Our daughter is experiencing delays across multiple developmental areas. Compared to her peers, she is behind in speech and language, social interaction, motor skills, and cognitive development. She does not have any areas of overachievement.

Learning new things is challenging for her because she shows little interest in educational toys, books, or activities that typically engage children her age. She does not respond to attempts to teach her new words or concepts, as she is not interested in what adults say to her. Her limited attention span and tendency to wander off make it difficult to engage her in learning opportunities.

---

#### **Please describe the child/young person’s independence skills.**

Our daughter's independence skills are significantly behind for her age. She still relies heavily on us to meet her basic needs and communicates primarily through crying, similar to a much younger child. She cannot effectively communicate her needs or understand instructions, which limits her ability to perform simple tasks independently.

She is unsteady on her feet, falls frequently, and requires assistance after falling. While she often wanders around alone, she needs constant supervision and redirection to ensure her safety, especially because she frequently climbs on furniture and could injure herself.

She is not able to perform self-care tasks typical for her age, such as feeding herself with utensils, attempting to dress herself, or assisting with simple routines. Her lack of independence places additional demands on our family.

---

### **Parents/Carers**

#### **How have you explained your Autism concerns to the Parents? What is their understanding?**

As parents, we are aware of autism spectrum disorders, as our older children have been diagnosed with ASD. We recognize similar signs and behaviors in our daughter that align with autism characteristics, such as communication difficulties, social challenges, repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities. We understand the importance of early intervention and are seeking an assessment to better support her needs.

---

### **Child / Young Person’s Strengths**

#### **Tell us the things the child/young person is good at and what you like about them.**

Our daughter has several strengths and positive qualities that we cherish:

1. **Interest in Animals**: She has a keen interest in animals and enjoys watching birds and cats. Observing wildlife brings her joy, and it's delightful to see her engaged in these moments.

2. **Resilience**: When she falls while climbing, she isn't scared to keep trying. Her persistence and determination are admirable traits that we love about her.

3. **Appreciation for Music**: She shows excitement when she hears music, displaying enthusiasm by jumping and rocking. Music seems to be something she genuinely enjoys.

4. **Physical Energy**: She has moments where she engages in physical activities with energy and enthusiasm, which can be delightful to watch.

We love her curiosity and the unique ways she explores her environment. We are hopeful that with the right support, she can continue to develop her strengths and overcome her challenges.
